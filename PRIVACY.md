# Privacy statement

## Introduction

We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing users with a safe and functional personal learning and development environment. This Statement of Privacy applies to the app Mahara Mobile as provided by Catalyst IT Limited and governs data collection and usage.

## Collection of personal information

By using the full potential of the application, you will need to log into the Mahara site that you are using for your portfolio work. The login form for internal Mahara or LDAP accounts sits in the mobile app whereas single sign-on takes you to your Mahara site.

Your own name is displayed in the app once you are logged in, and you are connected to your Mahara account via an access token that is stored in the app as well as on Mahara itself so the two can communicate with each other.

## How we use your personal information

Neither the Mahara project nor Catalyst has access to any of the data that you enter on Mahara Mobile. The institution that hosts the Mahara site that you connect to cannot access data in your Mahara Mobile app either.

## Storage and security of your personal information

We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the connection between Mahara Mobile and a Mahara site you connect to is secure from the app perspective and that your access information is not disclosed.

Neither the Mahara project nor Catalyst IT Limited are responsible though for maintaining the Mahara site that you connect to. It is the responsibility of the organization providing the Mahara service to keep the site and its content secure.

In order to help protect your personal information, please do not disclose your username or password to anybody or allow them to view content you are planning to upload to your Mahara site via Mahara Mobile. Once content has been uploaded, file names, descriptions and journal titles and entries are not available via the app anymore. Files will still be stored in their original location of your app.

## Changes to this privacy statement

We may occasionally make adjustments to our privacy statement to reflect changes to the system and in response to customer feedback. As such we suggest you check the Privacy Statement each time you visit this app.

## Contact

If you have any questions regarding this Statement or believe we have not adhered to the above criteria, please contact us at https://mahara.org/contact.php and we will use all reasonable efforts to remedy the issue.
